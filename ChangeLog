* Guarded all fopen calls with an if, to check whether opening was successful and abort otherwise

2010-06-16:
* Moved all simulators into a separate repository/module
* Moved all benchmarks shared by the different Chronos versions into a separate repository
* Added autotool support for setting all paths (to lp_solve, to simple scalar gcc, etc.)
* All input files for Chronos must now be specified directly (<path>/l1.config instead of l1 for caches for example). This enables a separation of the analyzer and its input files/benchmarks
* Rewrote the scripts for simulating, compiling and analyzing with Chronos
