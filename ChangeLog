2010-07-26:
* Integrated debugmacros into Chronos. The C++ debugmacros library which enables a selective, run-time decided, fully removable (per define) debug output support.
* All debug output in the main analyzer was switched to debugmacros (The 'wcrt' and 'cfg' modules still use their old debug output)

2010-07-24:
* First version of global convergence analysis finished
* Changed cache analysis result evaluation. Instead of statically attaching either a best- or a worst-case classification to each instruction, a new function was introduced that derives the access behaviour from the CHMC dynamically. All the DAG-based analyses were adapted to use that function (check_hit_miss). This enables concurrent BCET/WCET analyses like the alignment analysis. 

2010-07-23:
* Streamlined different DAG-based WCET analyses
- All analyses now use the same function for getting the memory access delay + latency
- The context-handling in the unroll-analyses was corrected
- All analyses now have a configurable per-instruction WCET and BCET (This was previously 0 or 1 (heterogenous))
* Switched to C99 in the Makefiles because long long is not supported in older standards
* BCET analysis now has separate data structures. This enables a parallel BCET and WCET analysis, which would have written to the same struct fields, and thus would have overwritten each	other, previously.

2010-07-22:
* Simplified the bus delay computation.    
* Nested loop headers do now get the correct starting time, which was not handled correctly before. Inner loops always got starting time 0 in the outer loop too, which leads to wrong results.

2010-07-21:
* Restructured loop WCET determination from CHMC contexts
* Separated the fully-unrolling WCET analysis from the structural WCET analysis (as presented in SCOPES) to be able to more easily switch between the different analyses and to identify which parts of the code belong to which analysis

2010-07-16:
* In main.c: Moved Wei-Statistics to separate functions and modularized msc reading / wcet-bcet output

2010-07-07:
* Split up the DAG-analyses into WCET/BCET and independent parts
* Fixed all warnings in the code

2010-06-06:
* Added header files for all source files, so that the standard C build system is applicable (compile one source after another and link at the end)

2010-06-18:
* Changed "wcrt" folder to be a library

2010-06-17:
* Guarded all fopen calls with an if, to check whether opening was successful and abort otherwise

2010-06-16:
* Moved all simulators into a separate repository/module
* Moved all benchmarks shared by the different Chronos versions into a separate repository
* Added autotool support for setting all paths (to lp_solve, to simple scalar gcc, etc.)
* All input files for Chronos must now be specified directly (<path>/l1.config instead of l1 for caches for example). This enables a separation of the analyzer and its input files/benchmarks
* Rewrote the scripts for simulating, compiling and analyzing with Chronos
