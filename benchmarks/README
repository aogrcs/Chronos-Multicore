The benchmarks are split up into two folders:

* singlecore
  This folder holds all the source code for the benchmarks and the 
  compiled code / analysis results / etc. if that was already generated

* multicore
  This folder onyl contains information about the used multicore
  architectures (especially about used bus schedules and cache
  configurations) and about the multicore test cases which are
  composed of multiple singlecore test cases which are mapped onto
  the different processors with optional precedence constraints.
