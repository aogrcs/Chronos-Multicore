These are the multicore benchmarks used for simulation and analysis in Chronos.
All relevant information is stored in the subfolders, which are:

* schedules
  Holds all possible TDMA schedules. These can then be used in simulation and
  analysis to form a complete system.

* caches
  Holds all the known cache configurations. These can then be used in simulation and
  analysis to form a complete system.

* setups
  This folder holds the configurations of full systems, together with the 
  description of the benchmarks for the single cores (taken from the singlecore
  folder) and their dependencies.

To invoke the analyzer or the simulator one does need 
a) a schedule file
b) cache config files (one for each level)
c) a setup file that describes the application to be executed
