Hi Vivy

I have put the tar ball in /tmp on abhikhosts.
It includes the source code and serveral benchmarks.
Steps for making it work:
1. untar it into a directory, say, foo
2. type "make" to compile it
3. suppose your want the cfg of a benchmark -- matsum,
   just type: "run.sh matsum"
   it will produce the cfg of it.
   the source code and object code is in directory
   benchmark/matsum.

For more details, let's discuss it in person.

best regards
