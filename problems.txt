### cfg

No problems here

### m_cache

Why is the interference information hidden in a file whose only content is a path to another file? One could use the path to that file as the command line argument then, directly.

### simplesim-3.0:

No problems here

### ss_smt:

Invoking "make" fails with 

/app/unido-i12/x86_64/binutils/2.19/bin/ld: errno: TLS definition in /lib/libc.so.6 section .tbss mismatches non-TLS reference in eval.o
/lib/libc.so.6: could not read symbols: Bad value

I'm not sure whether this is just a local error, but in case you stumbled over it too, you might be able to help me out here.

### test

What's the purpose of this folder?


In General:
* Common repository makes sense?
